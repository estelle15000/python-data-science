Let's take an example.

Imagine a desert island where a deadly virus takes hold.

Every day, a tenth of the population dies.

We might say that:

Number dying per day = 0.1 x population

Let's now write this using maths symbols:

- dN / dt = 0.1 x N

where:

dN / dt = Number dying per day

The negative sign tells us that people dying decreases the population (it's a negative change)

N = Population

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE POPULATION, N ?

The population, N, will obviously decrease every day.

This means that the number of people dying every day will also decrease.

For example:

On day zero the population is 10 000 and then the virus arrives

On day one the population starts at 10 0000 so 1000 die

On day two the population starts at 9000 so 900 die

On day three the population starts at 8100 so 810 die

and so on.

CAN I WORK OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE ALIVE AFTER 12 DAYS?

Well, you could work it out as I have done above for three days, but just keep going until you get to day 12.

But that would be a bit tedious.

So a quicker way is look at our equation again.

Here it is:

- dN / dt = 0.1 x N

This type of equation is called a differential equation.

The nice thing about differential equations is that we can write them in a different way.

So we can write any differential equation in a way that looks totally different.

When we do this we say that we are going to "solve the differential equation."

If we solve: - dN / dt = 0.1 x N

We get:

N = n x e^-0.1xt

n= the population to begin with (on day zero)

e = 2.71 ( this is an important number in maths and physics called the exponential constant)

t = the number of days I am interested in

N = the population after t days.

So, after 12 days:

N = n x e^-0.1xt

N = 10 000 x e^-0.1x12

N = 10 000 x e^-1.2

If you use your scientific calculator to work out e^-1.2 you will get 0.30

So: N = 10 000 x 0.30

N = 3000

After 12 days the population will be 3000.

HOW DO I SOLVE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS?

If you study calculus this is one of the things you will learn to do.

WHY ARE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IMPORTANT?

All sorts of things in the world around us can be described by differential equations.

So they are really important in Physics.

And by knowing how to solve them we can work things out much more quickly than having to go through lots of steps.

HERE ARE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

1. The change in height per day of water in a particular tank that has a hole in its base.

- dH / dt = 0.2 H

dH / dt = change in height of water per day

H = height of water in the tank

You will see that the leaking water means the height of water in the tank drops by one fifth of its new height every day.

Notice the negative sign again because the height is decreasing.

The solution of this differential equation is:

H = h x e^-0.2 x t

So we can work out the height, H, of water t days after the tank was full at a height, h.

The 0.2 will be a different number for a different tank as it depends on the size of the hole.

2. The amount of charge, Q, that flows every second from a capacitor (a device that stores charge).

- dQ / dt = 0.04 x Q

dQ / dt = charge flowing from the capacitor every second.

Q = charge stored in the capacitor.

In this example, the capacitor loses 4% of its remaining charge every second.

The solution of this differential equation is:

Q = q x

e^-0.04 x t

So we can work out the charge, Q, still stored in the capacitor t seconds after the capacitor had a full charge, q.

The 0.04 will depend on the type of capacitor and the electrical resistance of the circuit.

3. The number of radioactive atoms that emit radiation every second

- dN / dt = 0.0005 N

dN / dt = the number of atoms that emit radiation every second

N = number of radioactive atoms that have not yet emitted radiation

So we see that 0.05 % of the atoms that have not yet emitted radiation will emit radiation every second.

QUESTION

You might like to have a go at this question:

(a) Write down what you think is the solution of this differential equation

(b) If a sample of this radioactive material contains one million atoms that have not emitted radiation, how many atoms will there be that have still not emitted after 60 seconds?

[You should get an answer of about 970 446 atoms]

THERE ARE LOTS OF TYPES OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION THAT YOU WILL COME ACROSS IN CALCULUS.

Isaac Newton invented calculus to help him explain his theories.

It is still as useful today as it was over three hundred years ago.
